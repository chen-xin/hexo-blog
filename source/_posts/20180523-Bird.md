Getting up early not only introduces city of 4am,
but also entertains you with free concert of various birds.
I know in dawn roosters crow, but never know many other birds
also sing untill recently, or, I just had forgotten.
I was night owl since my student age, about 20 years ago.
At first I enjoin my finalcial independance,
free from desciplin, and indulge myself to WOW. 

As a mid-aged man, there are endless work at office,
and endless homework at home. I start to miss student age.
A particular day schedule for me would be: 

  7:00 get up, breakfirst;

  8:00-18:00 work, lunch, nap at office

  19:00-21:00 make kids complete there homework

  21:00-?? play with kids

There would be no time for to revite my dreaming student age.
Last month, I encountered an introduce to a Japanese woman,
doctor, mother of 4 children, Havard PHd. She makes her time
by sleep at 9pm, the same time as the kids, and get up at 3am,
then she earned 4 extra hours a day, without any distraction.
What a good idea!
